# DESCRIPTION

Simulation data corresponding to the electrostatic calculations and molecular simulations reported in our publication:

Miquel Castellote-Borrell, Marc Domingo, Francesca Merlina, Huixia Lu, Salut Colell, Mireia Bachiller, Manel Juan, Sonia Guedan, Jordi Faraudo*, Judith Guasch* "Lymph-Node Inspired Hydrogels Enhance CAR Expression and Proliferation of CAR T Cells" [ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2025, 17, 11, 16548–16560](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.4c19942)

The data corresponds to the calculation of the interaction between the VSV-G protein and the heparin component of the hydrogel.

Electrostatic calculations: APBS calculation of the VSV-G trimer:

-apbs.in: Input file used for the calculation of the electrostatic potential of the VSV-G protein.

-VSV-G.pqr: Pqr file used in the electrostatic potential calculation.


Molecular Dynamics of the VSV-G monomer and heparin:

- solvate.pdb: Initial configuration for the MD simulation reported in the main paper.
   
- solvate.psf: PSF file.
